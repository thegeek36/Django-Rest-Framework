# DRF Learning Journey 📚🚀

Welcome to my DRF (Django Rest Framework) learning repository! Here's a brief overview of my progress so far:

## Day 1: API Fundamentals 🌐

- Explored the fundamentals of APIs, their applications, and advantages.
- Designed a dummy database.
- Created a serializer class to retrieve JSON responses from the database.

## Day 2: Serializer Mastery 📝

- Dived deeper into serializers, a core DRF concept.
- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs using both function-based and class-based views.

## Day 3: Validators and Model Serializers 🛡️

- Learned about different types of API validators:
  - Field Level Validators
  - Object Level Validators
  - Custom Validators
- Explored the power of Model Serializers in DRF.
- Demonstrated how to use validators in Model Serializers.
- Created and tested various dummy APIs to validate functionalities.

## Day 4: Function-Based and Class-Based API Views 📄
- Deepened the understanding of API views.
- Explored Function-Based API Views and their applications.
- Studied Class-Based API Views and their benefits.
- Delved into Request and Response objects, understanding them in-depth for crafting robust APIs.
- Developed CRUD APIs using class and function based views.

## Day 5: Generic Views, Mixins, and Concrete View Classes 🔄

- Learned about Generic API Views for streamlining common operations.
- Explored Mixins and how they can be used to add functionalities to views.
- Gained insights into Concrete View Classes for more specialized views.
- Well-documented code for better understanding and future reference.

## Day 6: Mastering ViewSets 🌟

- Introduced to ViewSets in Django, a powerful tool for simplifying view creation.
- Enhanced knowledge and practical skills for building APIs efficiently.

## Day 7: Model ViewSets to make CRUD API easier 📚

- Learned about ModelViewSets in DRF and how it makes the code simple and easy.
- Developed  a CRUD API using the same.

## Day 8: Authentication and Permissions 🔐

- Learned about Authentication classes in DRF, including Basic Authentication.
- Explored Permissions to control access to API endpoints.
- Created different types of users and thoroughly tested the APIs for security and functionality.

## Day 9: Function-Based Authentication 🤖

- Practiced Function-Based Authentication methods to enhance API security.
- Strengthened knowledge of authentication mechanisms within DRF.

## Day 10: Token Authentication and Creation 🗝️
- Introduced Token Authentication in DRF for securing API endpoints.
- Explored methods to create tokens using signals, CLI, and the admin panel.
- Pushed Day 10 updates along with Day 11 due to a mistake.

## Day 11: CLI API Requests and CRUD Operations 🌐
- Learned how to make API requests from the command line using the HTTPie library.
- Performed CRUD operations on APIs using the command line.
- Continuously advancing my skills in DRF for practical application.

## Day 12: Custom Authentication and its operations

- Got insights on custom authentication and how it works.
- Documentated the code for more understanding
